## 5. Explosives: From Gunpowder to Magic Marble

IRA的IED在当时是最先进的，它们部署了定时、引爆和诱捕机制；制造它们的人以及他们获得的专业知识；以及军队爆炸物处理（EOD）部队如何应对几乎每天都在挑战这些装置和不断发展的技术。 IRA使用了比任何其他恐怖组织都多的炸药类型。他们开始使用商业炸药，并且变得擅长制造自己的炸药。后来获得的Semtex军用高爆炸药被单独使用或用于增强种类日益增长的自制炸药，制造出越来越复杂的装置。在其历史上，爱尔兰与炸弹和制造炸弹同义。关于"Paddy factor"的愚蠢和冒犯性的爱尔兰笑话——爱尔兰人用自己的炸弹炸死自己，或者制造未引爆的炸弹——不应被认真对待。早期的IRA炸弹制造者确实把自己炸死了。但他们很快学会了如何不这样做。

> improvised explosive devices (IEDs) — including the many types of explosives the organisation acquired and used; the timing, detonation and booby trap mechanisms deployed to make the IRA’s IEDs the most advanced of their time; the people who made them and the expertise they acquired; and how the army Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) units coped with the almost daily challenges of countering these devices and the evolving technologies used. The IRA has used more types of explosives than any other terrorist group to date. They began with commercial explosives and became adept at making their own. The later acquisition of Semtex military high-explosive was used either solely or to boost a growing range of homemade explosives in devices of ever-increasing complexity. At regular intervals in its history, Ireland has been synonymous with bombs and bomb-making. No idiotic and offensive Irish joke about the ‘Paddy factor’ — Irishmen blowing themselves up with their own bombs, or making bombs that failed to go off — should be taken seriously. Early IRA bomb-makers did blow themselves up. But they quickly learned how not to.

### GUNPOWDER AND PIPE BOMBS

在19世纪中叶，随着芬尼安党的出现，爱尔兰共和军早期武装运动开始使用炸药。他们使用至少200磅的火药(此时应该还是黑火药)摧毁了伦敦克莱肯威尔监狱的操场以及周围的街道，造成12人死亡，15人永久残疾，126人严重受伤。报纸的反应突显了伦敦人的震惊和恐慌，就像今天的小报一样。

> The use of explosives for the early Irish republican armed campaign began with the emergence of the Fenians in the mid-nineteenth century, who used at least 200 lbs of gunpowder to demolish the London Clerkenwell jail exercise yard as well as the adjoining streets, killing twelve, permanently disabling fifteen and seriously injuring 126.' The response from newspapers highlighted the shock and panic among Londoners that accrued, much in the way the tabloids do today.

### 'INFERNAL MACHINES' - FENIAN DYNAMITE

在19世纪70年代，总部位于美国的盖尔族开始大胆思考，与爱尔兰共和兄弟会和“散兵游勇”派别一起考虑未来的炸弹袭击如何超越克莱肯威尔爆炸的极限。然后，在1863年，瑞典工业家、工程师和发明家阿尔弗雷德·诺贝尔意外地发现了如何将高度不稳定的液态硝化甘油炸药混合并安全地包装成一种可塑性膏剂，他称之为'Dynamite'。1865年，他发现硝化甘油可以通过铜管中的雷酸汞引爆器引爆，第二年他发现硝化甘油可以通过吸附在硅藻土中来抵抗冲击。将75%的硝化甘油与25%的硅藻土混合，产生了一种足够稳定的炸药，可以用锤子敲击而不会点燃，但当用雷酸盐引爆器引爆时会全力爆炸。

为了能够引爆炸药棒，诺贝尔还发明了一个由点燃导火索引爆的雷管。炸药可以分装成测量过的药量，易于运输，并且使用正确的雷管可以安全地爆炸。它被归类为二次高爆炸药，这意味着使用一次或初始高爆炸药（例如雷酸汞）的雷管来引爆主药。

硝化甘油的稳定和Dynamite的发明意味着可以制造大规模爆炸的炸弹，这些炸弹可以相对容易和安全地制造、运输和放置——使其成为采矿、建筑和采石业的理想商业炸药——也适用于恐怖分子。事实上，19世纪浪漫时期，爱尔兰裔美国人将炸药视为从英格兰残酷殖民统治下解放爱尔兰的伟大解放者。

在诺贝尔发明仅两年后，盖尔族就在其领导人威廉·麦基·洛马斯尼（William Mackey Lomasney）的倡议下开始试验新型炸药，他曾指挥在全国范围内使用和运输硝化甘油。’ 炸药更大的可塑性和稳定性使其成为非法制造者需要快速安全地将装置移动到目标位置并构造它而不被炸毁的完美选择。1881年7月，在SS Malta靠泊利物浦后，在船上发现了6枚被媒体称为“地狱机器”的炸药棒。散兵游勇基金由一个由三名盖尔族成员组成的内部圈子控制，称为三角形；这使得运动能够开始对英格兰进行“炸药战争”。

对恐怖分子来说同样重要的是，诺贝尔的雷酸汞引爆过程意味着炸弹可以在放置后几分钟或几小时内设置引爆。因此，在引爆炸弹时不再需要亲自到场。这种能力使“炸药战争”成为历史上第一个定时炸弹恐怖活动。我将在下一章详细讨论定时机制。

使用这种爆炸物变得足够普遍，以至于芬尼安运动被称为“炸药战争”。1867年至1887年间，盖尔族至少种植了60枚炸弹，摧毁了至少10座建筑物和纪念碑，并杀死了至少100人。’ 1883年3月至1885年2月间，在伦敦发生了13起恐怖袭击事件。仅两枚伦敦地铁上的炸弹就造成了多达60人受伤；* 1885年1月24日被称为“Dynamite Saturday”——当时芬尼安恐怖分子用恐怖分子对议会大厦和伦敦塔造成了巨大损失。其他地方还有格拉斯哥和利物浦。


> The US-based Clan na Gael began to think big during the 1870s, when,along with factions of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and the ‘Skirmishers’ considered how future bomb attacks could exceed the limits of the Clerkenwell explosion. Then, in 1863, the Swedish industrialistengineer and inventor Alfred Nobel discovered by accident how to mix and safely package the highly unstable liquid nitroglycerin explosive into a malleable paste, which he called 'dynamite'. In 1865, he discovered that nitroglycerin could be detonated by a mercury fulminate primer in a copper tube, and the following year that nitroglycerin could be rendered insensitive to shock by adsorption in diatomaceous earth, or kieselguhr. Combining 75 per cent nitroglycerin with 25 per cent kieselguhr produced an explosive that was stable enough to be banged with a hammer without igniting, but would explode with full power when detonated by a fulminate primer.’
>
> To be able to detonate the dynamite rods, Nobel also invented a detonator or blasting cap that was ignited by lighting a fuse. Dynamite can be packed in measured charges, transported easily and, with the proper detonator, exploded safely. It is classified as a secondary high explosive, which means a detonator of primary or initiating high explosive (mercury fulminate, for example) is utilised to set off the main charge.
>
> The stabilising of nitroglycerin and the invention of gelignite(此处原书如此，依上下文应为Dynamite。) meant that it was possible to build bombs to cause massive explosions which could be manufactured, transported, and placed with relative ease and security — making it ideal as a commercial explosive for mining, construction and quarrying — and also for terrorists. Indeed, dynamite was seen, in nineteenth-century romantic fashion, by Irish-Americans as the Great Liberator from England's tyrannical colonisation of Ireland.
>
> Only two years after Nobel's invention, Clan na Gael began to experiment with the new explosive under the initiative of their leader, William Mackey Lomasney, who had directed the use and movement of nitroglycerin around the country.’ Dynamite’s greater malleability and stability made it a perfect choice for the illicit bomb-maker needing to move a device quickly and safely to its target and, indeed, to construct it without being blown up. In July 1881 six dynamite bombs, dubbed ‘infernal machines’ by the press, were discovered aboard the SS Malta after it docked in Liverpool on arriving from the United States. The Skirmishing Fund came under the control of an inner circle consisting of three members of Clan na Gael, known as The Triangle; which enabled the movement to begin the ‘dynamite war’ against England.’
>
> Also of prime importance to the terrorist was that Nobel’s fulminate mercury detonation process meant that bombs could, for the first time, be set to detonate minutes or hours after they had been planted. It was therefore no longer necessary to be physically present when detonating a bomb. This capability distinguished the ‘dynamite war’ as the first timed bomb terrorist campaign in history.
>
> The use of the explosive became prevalent enough for the Fenian campaign to be known as the ‘dynamite war’. Between 1867 and 1887 Clan na Gael planted at least sixty bombs, destroyed at least ten buildings and monuments and killed at least 100 people.’ Between March 1883 and February 1885 thirteen dynamite devices exploded in London. As many as sixty people were injured by just two bombs on the London underground;* and 24 January 1885 was dubbed ‘Dynamite Saturday’ — when great damage was done to the Houses of Parliament and the Tower of London by Fenian dynamite explosions. Other dynamite devices went off in Glasgow and Liverpool.

### 'TT TICKS AWAY THE GELIGER-NITE ...'

到1875年，诺贝尔发明了“爆胶”——凝胶炸药，它产生的爆炸比硝化甘油产生的爆炸更强大，IRA在下一个世纪的不同时期都会使用它，例如在1939年的大陆运动中。凝胶炸药由一半以上的硝化甘油、胶棉、硝酸钾、木粉和白垩组成。它是一种血管扩张剂，会引起头痛（Shane Paul O'Doherty描述的“果冻”头痛，见下文）、低血压、胸痛和可能的心脏病发作。

注：胶棉是粘性较强的硝化棉

在1920年代激烈战斗期间的袭击和伏击经常使用凝胶炸药。1920年5月对纽敦汉密尔顿RIC兵营的一次袭击，开始时IRA向兵营开火并向屋顶投掷一连串炸弹。然后他们占领了一家酒吧，在志愿者在建筑物侧墙上挖出的洞中插入凝胶炸药，该墙将其与兵营的日间室分开。爆炸物在墙上打开了一个缺口，使IRA能够进入兵营，迫使警察撤退到建筑物后面。然后IRA用土豆喷雾器将汽油或煤油浸透建筑物前面，将兵营点燃。

> By 1875 Nobel had invented ‘blasting gelatin’ — gelignite - which created a significantly more powerful explosion than that generated by nitroglycerin, and which the IRA would employ at various times in the next century, such as during the 1939 mainland campaign. Gelignite is made up of over half nitroglycerin, collodion cotton, potassium nitrate, wood meal, and chalk. It is a vasodilator, which makes it cause headaches (the ‘gelly’ headache as described by Shane Paul O’Doherty, see below), low blood pressure, chest pains, and possible heart attacks.
>
> Attacks and ambushes during the bitter fighting of the 1920s often featured gelignite. One attack, on Newtownhamilton RIC barracks in May 1920, began with the IRA opening fire on the barracks and throwing a volley of bombs onto its roof. They then occupied a public house, where gelignite was inserted in holes the volunteers had made in the building’s gable wall, which separated it from the day room of the barracks. The explosives blew a breach in the wall enabling the IRA to enter the barracks, forcing the police to retire to the rear of the building. The IRA then set the barracks on fire, using potato sprayers to soak the front of the building with petrol or paraffin.

在Tan War期间，氯酸钾也被使用。尽管武器被没收，但迈克尔·柯林斯的武器走私网络仍在不断恢复，到1921年5月，一吨氯酸钾从利物浦假装成面包苏打运到爱尔兰。

> During the Tan War potassium chlorate was also used. The Michael
Collins arms smuggling network kept regenerating despite arms seizures
and by May 1921 a tonne of potassium chlorate was coming over to
Ireland from Liverpool disguised as bread soda.”

在20世纪70年代，临时性爱尔兰共和军使用爆胶制造路边炸弹。一种常用的策略是将爆胶放入牛奶罐中，然后将其放在路边，与农民晚上放出来由乳品厂收集的其他几十个容器一起。”当军队巡逻队经过时，罐子会被遥控引爆。这现在是伊拉克的典型攻击方式，尽管牛奶罐可能被其他常见物品所取代。

一位在使用爆胶方面经验丰富的IRA特工是Shane Paul O'Doherty，他的壮举被记录在他的自传《志愿者》中，他的专业知识将在下一章详细介绍。他开始制造炸弹的职业生涯是使用一根爆胶棒放在装满钉子的啤酒罐中。”O’Doherty还使用了黑色爆胶。

尽管IRA在20世纪80年代和90年代的许多IEDs包括硝酸铵和/或Semtex，但爆胶仍然被使用。布莱顿炸弹是最臭名昭著的例子；它由13到23千克（30-50 Ib）的爆胶组成，炸弹手Patrick Magee在他的格拉斯哥公寓里藏了大约60千克的爆胶。1982年7月海德公园爆炸案中也使用了爆胶，其中一个装置除了11千克爆胶外还包含钉子。

> In the 1970s the Provisional IRA used gelignite for roadside bombs. A favourite tactic was to put gelignite into a milk churn, then stand it by the roadside among dozens of other containers that farmers put out at night to be collected by the dairies.” When an army patrol passed by, the churn would be detonated by remote control. This is now a typical mode of attack in Iraq, although milk churns may be replaced by a plethora of other commonplace objects.
>
> An IRA operative experienced in the use of gelignite was Shane Paul O'Doherty, whose exploits were recorded in his autobiography The Volunteer and whose expertise will be detailed in the next chapter. He began his bomb-making career using a stick of gelignite in the centre of a beer can full of nails.” O’Doherty also used black gelatine.
>
> Although many of the IRA’s IEDs in the 1980s and 1990s comprised ammonium nitrate and/or Semtex, gelignite continued to be used. The Brighton bomb was the most notorious example; it consisted of between 13 and 23 kg (30-50 Ib) of gelignite, and the bomber, Patrick Magee, had hidden around 60 kg of it in his Glasgow apartment. Gelignite was also used in the Hyde Park bombing of July 1982, where one of the devices contained nails along with the 11 kg of gelignite.

### THE ‘SINN FEIN CONJUROR’S OUTFIT’

20世纪30年代和40年代的IEDs也使用了许多其他爆炸物，包括：

氯酸钾——一种常用的氯酸盐，与火药混合使用或替代其较弱的成分硝酸钾。由于存在硫，它极不稳定。氯酸钾与增塑剂（如蜡）的混合物是第一次世界大战中最常用的塑料炸药类型，常用于填充手榴弹和其他弹药。

碳化物——用于烟火。为了制造爆炸，碳化物和水的混合物被放入一个带盖的牛奶罐中，并用火炬点燃。

> IEDs of the 1930s and 1940s also used a host of other explosives, including:
>
> Potassium chlorate — a common chlorate used in combination with gunpowder or to replace its less powerful ingredient, potassium nitrate. It is extremely unstable due to the sulphur present. Mixes of potassium chlorate with plasticisers (such as wax) were the most common type of plastic explosive used in the First World War, often filling grenades and other munitions.”
>
> Carbide — is used in fireworks. To create an explosion, a mixture of carbide and water was put in a milk churn with a lid and ignited with a torch.

要发现IRA在20世纪50年代到70年代使用了哪些爆炸物，只需参考1956年版的IRA训练手册《绿皮书》——这是在Provos的全盛时期之前很久，列出了志愿者可以使用和如何处理的令人眼花缭乱的商业和军事爆炸物。它们包括，除了爆胶：

808——一种早期的塑料炸药，也是由诺贝尔发明的，看起来像绿色的橡皮泥，闻起来像杏仁（像氰化物）；

TNT，经典的军用爆炸物，最初用于第一次世界大战中填充穿甲弹，并现在用作炸弹的标准度量，它很难引爆，以至于在1910年被免除了1875年爆炸物法案；

Ammonal——一种在第一次世界大战中首次使用的爆炸物，由硝酸铵、三硝基甲苯和铝粉按大约22:67:11的比例混合而成。铝使它对引爆不太敏感。‘相对便宜的硝酸铵和铝的使用使它成为纯TNT的替代品

从烟火中获得的火药”和水下拆除爆炸物——‘Tonite’——最初用于英国海岸周围航运安全的雾信号。”

湿硝化棉——一部分细棉花浸泡在十五部分硫酸和硝酸的等量混合物中。它适用于爆破但非常敏感。当1845年发明了硝化纤维素作为现代推进剂的第一步时，它被使用。当用作火枪子弹推进剂时，棉花产生与较大重量的火药相同的速度

"Co-op"混合物——氯酸钠和硝基苯的混合物。这个术语也用于IRA的硝酸铵混合物之一。（通过使用低速子弹燃烧混合物来破坏Co-op混合装置被证明是无效的，但标准SLR步枪发射的高速弹丸有时会起作用。”）

> To discover which explosives the IRA used from the 1950s to 1970s one only has to refer to the 1956 edition of the IRA's training manual, the Green Book — which, and this is long before the heyday of the Provos, lists a bewildering array of commercial and military explosives the volunteer can expect to use and how to handle them. They included, as well as gelignite:
>
> 808 — an early plastic explosive, also invented by Nobel, which looks like green plasticine and smells of almonds (like cyanide);
>
> TNT, the classic military explosive first used in the First World War to fill armour-piercing shells and now used as the standard measure of bombs, and was so hard to detonate that in 1910 it was exempted from the 1875 Explosives Act;
>
> Ammonal — an explosive first used in the First World War, made up of ammonium nitrate, trinitrotoluene and aluminium powder mixed in a ratio of roughly 22:67:11. The aluminium makes it less sensitive to detonation. ‘The use of the relatively cheap ammonium nitrate and aluminium makes it a replacement for pure TNT
>
> Gunpowder gleaned from fireworks” and an underwater demolition explosive — ‘Tonite’ — originally used for fog signals for shipping safety around the British coast.”
>
> Wet guncotton — one part of fine cotton wool immersed in fifteen parts of an equal blend of sulphuric and nitric acids. It is suitable for blasting but highly sensitive. It was used when nitrocellulose had been invented in 1845 as a first step to modern propellants. When used as a bullet propellant in a musket, guncotton created the same amount of velocity as a larger weight of gunpowder
>
> Co-op mix — a blend of sodium chlorate and nitrobenzene. This term was also used for one of the IRA’s ammonium nitrate mixtures. (Disrupting Co-op mix devices by burning off the mixture by the use of low-velocity bullets proved ineffective, but high-velocity rounds from a standard SLR rifle sometimes worked.”)

### THE EXPLOSIVE TROUBLES BEGIN

在20世纪70年代初，随着北爱尔兰的运动获得了可怕的势头，英国军队UXO（未爆炸弹药）小组明确地认识到，对爆炸物和雷管的更严格控制是至关重要的。在20世纪70年代在阿尔斯特工作的英国军队EOD（爆炸物处理）专家之一，乔治·斯泰尔斯中校在他的著作《炸弹没有怜悯》中抱怨道，内政部认为军队应该更好地照顾它们以避免被盗。他和他的同事正在检查和记录当时使用的越来越多种类的装置的每一种成分和组件，这实际上摧毁了内政部的观念。

斯泰尔斯问为什么临时性爱尔兰共和军获得商业性——而非军事性——爆炸物。内政部没有答案，根据1875年爆炸物法案，爆炸物很容易获得。商业爆炸物如爆胶和Quarrex通过英国制造商从爱尔兰共和国运到贝尔法斯特，引发了边境安全问题（这个问题在我们当前全球爆炸物和核材料贩运时代仍然具有争议性）。斯泰尔斯和他的同事还必须仔细研究商业爆炸物，它们与军用爆炸物完全不同，因为后者更稳定，因此更安全——因为它们必须承受子弹撞击、从高处掉落和长期储存而不会爆炸。相比之下，商业爆炸物的保质期只有几个月，因为它很可能会在这段时间内用完。

当Provos首次使用自制混合物和管式炸弹时，显然他们正处于一个陡峭的学习曲线上。斯泰尔斯遇到了第一个管式炸弹，一个小金属物体靠在贝尔法斯特Ballymurphy庄园一所学校的墙上，并发现它包含了不稳定的混合物——杀草剂氯酸钠和家用糖。在这类装置的早期，由于使用材料的劣势，几名IRA制造炸弹者自己被炸死；作为爆炸物先驱，Provos无法准确评估它们有多纯——例如，爆炸物被放入塑料容器中，而不知道某些塑料会加速某些爆炸物的相互作用。他们最低限度的培训也不足以让他们准确地焊接和连接定时器。”结果，许多他们的炸弹过早地引爆。”其他商业爆炸物，如Greencast和爆胶，在20世纪70年代初期被使用。”20世纪70年代初期使用的爆炸物数量急剧增加，1972年可以说是冲突中最具爆炸性的一年，就设备数量和使用的爆炸物数量而言。在“血腥星期五”，1972年7月21日，在贝尔法斯特市中心一天内发生了22起爆炸，在一个月内——8月——有2660千克（5855 Ib）的爆炸物在126次爆炸中被引爆，但IRA可用的供应量至少是这个数量的两倍。”即使当局查获了大量货物（这种情况经常发生），库存中还有更多可用货物。到1972年中期，约有5000吨爆炸物被引爆。”

> At the start of the 1970s, as the campaign in Northern Ireland gained terrifying momentum, it became clear to British army UXO (unexploded ordnance) teams that tighter control of explosives and detonators was paramount. A leading British army EOD (explosive ordnance disposal) expert working in Ulster during the 1970s, Lt Col George Styles, in his book 'Bombs Have No Pity' complained bitterly that the Home Office felt the army should look after them better to avoid theft. He and his colleagues were examining and recording every ingredient and component of the growing number and variety of devices being used at the time, which in effect destroyed the Home Office’s notion.”
>
> Styles asked why the Provisional IRA was obtaining commercial — not military — explosives. The Home Office did not have the answer and explosives were easily acquired under the 1875 Explosives Act. Commercial explosives such as gelignite and Quarrex came to Belfast from the Irish Republic via English manufacturers, raising the controversial issue (and one that resounds still in our current era of explosives and worldwide nuclear-materials trafficking) of border security. Styles and his colleagues also had to closely study commercial explosives, which are totally different from military ones insofar as the latter are much more stable and therefore safer — as they have to endure bullet impact, drops from a great height, and long-term storage without exploding.” In contrast, a commercial explosive has a short shelf life of a few months, as it will tend to be used up within that time.
>
> When the Provos first used homemade mixtures and pipe bombs, it was evident that they were on a steep learning curve. Styles encountered the first pipe bomb, a small metal object propped against the wall of a school in Belfast's Ballymurphy estate, and found it contained an unstable mixture of sodium chlorate — weedkiller — and household sugar. In the early days of such devices, several IRA bomb-makers blew themselves up due to, Styles noted, the inferiority of the materials being used; as explosives pioneers, the Provos could not accurately assess how pure they were — for example, explosives were put into plastic containers, with no knowledge that some plastics accelerate the interaction of certain explosives. Nor was their minimal training sufficient to prepare them to accurately solder and wire the timing connections.” As a result, many of their bombs went off prematurely.” Other commercial explosives, such as Greencast and gelignite, were in use at the start of the 1970s onslaught.” The sheer amount of explosives used rose dramatically in the early 1970s with 1972 arguably the most explosive year of the conflict in terms of numbers of devices and amounts of explosives used. On ‘Bloody Friday’, 21 July 1972, twenty-two bombs exploded in one day in Belfast city centre and in one month — August — some 2,660 kg (5,855 Ib) of explosives were detonated in 126 explosions, but the supplies available to the IRA were at least twice this amount."' Even if the authorities seized vast amounts, as was regularly the case, there was so much more available in stock. By mid-1972, some 5,000 tonnes of explosives were being detonated.”

### FROM ‘PAXO’ TO ANFO AND ANNIE

爱尔兰共和军于1972年3月开始使用硝酸铵，当时在拆除的装置中检测到了硝酸铵的痕迹。”到了20世纪70年代中期，临时工作人员定期部署硝酸铵混合物，最著名的是ANFO（硝酸铵和燃油）——由商业炸药助爆，起初是爆胶，后来是塞姆汀。ANFO特别适用于汽车炸弹，因为汽车内有更多的空间，当它爆炸时——特别是油箱满时——增强了放置在其中的炸弹的助燃效果。这些致命的装置成为对北爱尔兰经济基础设施，后来是伦敦金融城的主要武器。爱尔兰共和军会在工业气缸中储存大量自制炸药（HME）。

> The IRA began using ammonium nitrate in March 1972, when traces were detected in defused devices.” By the mid-1970s the Provisionals were regularly deploying ammonium nitrate mixtures, most notably ANFO (ammonium nitrate and fuel oil) — boosted by a commercial explosive, at first gelignite and later Semtex. ANFO was particularly suit-able for car bombs as more space was available in a vehicle, which when it exploded — particularly with petrol tanks full — enhanced the incendiary effect of the bomb placed within it. These deadly devices became the main weapon against the economic infrastructure of Northern Ireland, and later the City of London. The IRA would store large amounts of homemade explosive (HME) in industrial gas cylinders.


硝酸铵已被用于某些炸药混合物中，并作为硝酸盐氧化剂用于烟火。它非常吸湿，必须防止受潮。它分解成氮和水，产生很少的烟雾，通过理想反应。多余的氧气可以用来氧化与硝酸盐混合的一些有机物质，如木粉、淀粉或柴油。

自1867年以来，这种类型的炸药已被广泛使用。它相当不敏感，必须强烈引爆，也许是通过Primacord雷管或类似的助爆器。爱尔兰共和军经常使用塞姆汀来助爆它。它的密度为1.725 g/cc。”

在存在甲烷爆炸危险的煤矿中获批使用的炸药通常主要含有硝酸铵，用硝化甘油敏化，以便可以用普通雷管（No. 6）引爆，并含有冷却盐，如硝酸钠或氯化钠，以及一些木粉或其他有机燃料。选择它是为了在爆炸时最小化火焰，并将其保持在不会点燃甲烷的温度以下。

> Ammonium nitrate has been used in certain dynamite mixes and as a nitrate oxidiser in pyrotechnics. It is very hygroscopic and must be protected against moisture. It decomposes to nitrogen and water, giving very little smoke, by the ideal reaction. The excess oxygen can be used to oxidise some organic material mixed with the nitrate, such as wood meal, starch or diesel oil.
>
> Explosives of this type have been widely used since 1867. It is rather insensitive, and must be strongly detonated, perhaps by a Primacord detonator or a similar booster. The IRA often used Semtex to boost it. Its density is 1.725 g/cc.”
>
> Explosives approved for use in coal mines where there is a hazard of methane (fire damp) explosions often contain mainly ammonium nitrate, sensitised with nitroglycerin so they can be exploded with normal detonators (No. 6), and cooling salts, such as sodium nitrate or sodium chloride, and some wood meal or other organic fuel. It is chosen to minimise the flame on explosion, and keep it below the temperature that will ignite the methane.”


硝酸铵肥料必须磨成细粉，然后干燥以去除水分。硝酸铵被压碎成小颗粒，用的工具从厨房搅拌机到水泥搅拌机都有。电动大麦碾碎机连接到拖拉机上，用于碾碎动物饲料，也被使用，因为南阿马格农场是主要的硝酸铵炸弹工厂，那里农业设备随时可用。”一旦磨成细粉状，其他成分被添加，如糖霜——可以说是最普遍的炸弹成分——作为助燃剂（类似于使用印度薄饼面粉，另一种多糖，它被混合到2005年7月21日试图在伦敦地铁列车上投放炸弹的罪犯拼凑起来的未爆装置中）。

基于肥料的炸弹通常相当大，通常放置在汽车、面包车或卡车中。少量高爆炸药（HE）通常用作助爆剂来引爆一卡车的肥料。当与柴油混合时，也很容易获得，爱尔兰共和军制造了一种称为ANFO（硝酸铵-燃油）的混合物。另一种由爱尔兰共和军开发的肥料混合物是ANNIE'——硝酸铵、硝基苯和柴油，并与助爆药剂混合。ANNIE也被称为“多尼戈尔混合物”。混合的目的是在爆炸时最小化火焰，并将其保持在不会点燃甲烷的温度以下。混合物有很多种，可以通过混合物中的成分来识别制造者。1988年5月，德里旅队在Strand Road RUC站内放置了七个塑料垃圾桶装满了ANNIE——超过720千克——在一辆偷来的带有假号牌的面包车内。这使面包车能够通过RUC检查站，该检查站会将汽车注册为合法——这是经典的IRA“ringer”把戏。这枚炸弹被拆除，以便当局能够确定爆炸物是如何组装起来的；铝粉具有极好的助燃性能，会与肥皂粉、柴油和锯末混合。油有助于铝粘附到硝酸铵上。混合得越好，主药剂硝酸铵对助爆剂（通常是塞姆汀）就越敏感。当它在初始爆炸中氧化时，会释放出大量的热量。这种热量也有助于延长引爆脉冲从而增加爆炸威力。木炭也可以使用，但效果较差。肥皂和锯末会增强引爆，因为它们有助于降低引爆速度和密度。引爆密度越大，爆炸达到最大威力就越困难。

黑色和白色火药也被用来提供比ANFO更强大的爆炸。硝酸铵也与硝基苯混合，并加入15%的铝粉。另一种混合物由糖、除草剂和火药组成，通常由少量塞姆汀引爆。1992年4月10日波罗的海交易所和1993年4月24日主教门的炸弹是爱尔兰共和军最大的装置，其中包括由塞姆汀点燃的自制硝酸铵和糖组合。主教门的炸弹估计重量在2至4吨之间。

> The ammonium nitrate fertiliser had to be milled to the correct consistency, then dried to remove water content. The ammonium nitrate was crushed into small particles in anything from kitchen mixers tocement mixers. Electric barley crushers attached to tractors and used to break down animal feed were also used, as farms in south Armagh were the main ammonium nitrate bomb factories, where such agricultural equipment was readily available.” Once milled to a fine consistency, other ingredients were added, such as icing sugar — arguably the most ubiquitous bomb ingredient ever — as an incendiary booster (similar to the use of chapatti flour, another polysaccharide, which was mixed into the unexploded devices that were cobbled together by those found guilty of attempting to bomb London tube trains on 21 July 2005).
>
> Fertiliser-based bombs are usually fairly large and are normally placed in a car, van or truck. A small amount of high explosive (HE) is usually used as a booster to detonate a truckload of it. When combined with diesel oil, which is also readily available, the IRA made a mixture known as ANFO (Ammonium Nitrate-Fuel Oil). The other IRA-pioneered fertiliser mix was ANNIE’ — ammonium nitrate, nitrobenzene and diesel oil, and combined with a booster charge. ANNIE was also known as ‘Donegal mix’. The aim in mixing is to minimise the flame on explosion, and keep it below the temperature that will ignite the methane. The mixes were many and various, and it was possible to identify the bomb-makers from the mix of ingredients. In May 1988 the Derry brigade placed seven plastic dustbins full of ANNIE — more than 720 kg — at Strand Road RUC station, inside a stolen van with false number plates. This enabled the van to get through the RUC checkpoint, which would register the car as legitimate — a classic IRA ‘ringer’ trick. The bomb was defused, so that the authorities could establish how the explosives had been put together; the ANNIE would have been ground into high-nitrogen fertiliser in a meticulous long-drawn out operation. Coffee grinders were often used, in relays. Aluminium powder, which has great incendiary properties, would be mixed with soap powder, diesel oil and sawdust. The oil helped the aluminium adhere to the ammonium nitrate. The better the mix, the more sensitive the main charge, the ammonium nitrate, would be to the booster (often Semtex). When it oxidises in the initial explosion, great amounts of heat are given off. The heat also helped to extend the detonation pulse thereby increasing the explosive power. Charcoal could also be used, but to lesser effect. Soap and sawdust would enhance the detonation as they help reduce the detonation velocity and density. The greater the detonation density, the harder it is for the explosion to have maximum power.

> Black and white gunpowder and super-amphor were also used to deliver a more powerful blast than ANFO.* Ammonium nitrate was also mixed with nitrobenzene, and with 15 per cent aluminium powder. Another mixture consisted of sugar, weedkiller and gunpowder and normally detonated by a small charge of Semtex. The 10 April 1992 Baltic Exchange and the 24 April 1993 Bishopsgate bombs were the largest IRA devices to incorporate homemade ammonium nitrate and sugar combinations ignited by Semtex. The bomb in Bishopsgate is estimated to have weighed between 2 and 4 tonnes.


### THE IRA’S MAGIC MARBLE

在20世纪70年代，爱尔兰共和军获得并磨练了制造越来越复杂的自制炸弹的技能。然后在20世纪80年代，最强大的非核炸药之一，也可以说是爱尔兰共和军最重要和最臭名昭著的武器之一，进入了武器库：塞姆汀炸药。只需要一小部分就能产生巨大的爆炸：只需要250克就能在1988年击落不幸的泛美航空飞机；只需要|千克就能炸毁一栋半独立式房屋。它是钚的常规炸药等价物。超过三吨——足以炸毁一个相当大的城市中心——是在1987年11月法国当局逮捕Eskund之前从利比亚到达爱尔兰的三批大量武器中的一部分。

> Having used commercial explosives up until the emergence of the Provisionals, the IRA during the 1970s acquired and honed their skills in making increasingly sophisticated home-made bombs. Then in the 1980s, one of the most powerful non-nuclear explosives, and arguably the IRA’s most significant and infamous weapon, entered the arsenal: Semtex. It takes just a small amount to pack a big blast: only 250 g was needed to down the ill-fated Pan Am aircraft over Lockerbie in 1988; a mere | kg is needed to blow up a semi-detached house. It is the conventional explosive equivalent of plutonium. More than three tonnes of it — enough to blow up a sizeable city centre — was among the three substantial shipments of arms that reached Ireland from Libya before the French authorities apprehended the Eskund in November 1987.

## 6. Deadly Ingenuity: The Bomb Technologies

### Projectiles, flash guns and infra-red

爆炸成型弹丸(EFP)在2007年伊拉克期间的众多路边爆炸中重新出现，它们是基于第二次世界大战时期的发现——Misznay-Schardin效应的爆炸装置，可以使用精确配置的高爆炸药来穿透军用车辆的厚装甲。使用弹丸可以在超出EOD工作人员通常扫描车辆主要路线的距离内穿透快速移动的装甲车辆。 The Provisionals在利比亚和叙利亚的培训中了解了如何开发和使用这些弹丸，特别是精确触发对这些装置的准确性至关重要。

>Explosively formed projectiles, which re-emerged in the numerous roadside bombings during the Iraqi insurgency in 2007, are explosive devices based on a Second World War-era discovery — the Misznay- Schardin effect — and can penetrate the thick armour of a military vehi- cle using a precisely configured high-explosive charge. The use of a projectile enables the penetration of fast-moving armoured vehicles at distances beyond those normally swept by EOD officers on the vehicles’ main routes. The Provisionals learned about developing and using these projectiles during training in Libya and Syria, specifically that precise triggering was vital to the accuracy of these devices.


精确定位是一个需要分秒必争的时机问题，因此这反过来又导致了IRA在指定时间引爆炸弹的进一步创新——通过从约100米远的地方发射相机闪光灯，击中光敏传感器以触发汽车携带的炸弹。照片闪光“从属”单元(Photo flash ‘slave’ units)由专业摄影师用来从相机产生的信号启动闪光单元。它们有两种变体——编码，发送特定信号；未编码，价格更便宜，但可能被任何脉冲光（如霓虹灯管）意外引爆。这种闪光灯方法由Newry的一个单位首创，并在1992年杀死RUC军官Colleen McMurray的炸弹中使用。她的同事Paul Slaine在袭击中失去了双腿。他后来因勇敢而获得乔治十字勋章。被攻击的警车当时正在驶出其兵营，当时IRA特工使用他的闪光枪(flash gun)触发了对该车辆的迫击炮发射。

> Pinpoint targeting was a matter of split-second timing, so this in turn led to a further IRA innovation in setting off bombs at an appointed time — by firing a camera flashlight from around 100 metres away, which struck a light-sensitive cell to trigger a car-borne mortar bomb. Photo flash ‘slave’ units are used by professional photographers to initiate flash units from a signal generated by the camera. They came in two variants — coded, which sends a specific signal, and uncoded, which are less expensive but which can be accidentally detonated by any pulsed light (such as a neon tube).” The flashlight method was pioneered by a unit in Newry and was used in a bomb that killed Colleen McMurray, an RUC officer, in 1992. Her colleague Paul Slaine lost both his legs in the attack. He was later awarded the George Cross for his bravery.” The police vehicle that was targeted was driving out of its barracks when the IRA operative used his flash gun to trigger the firing of the mortar at the vehicle.


一旦情报和未爆弹处理人员掌握了闪光枪技术，爱尔兰共和军就引入了一种利用红外传感器的方法，这种传感器用于远程开启和关闭车库门。这样做的好处是不会留下化学取证证据。红外设备使爱尔兰共和军的团队能够改进闪光技术，并在一英里以外引爆炸药。”据信，爱尔兰共和军利用1990年代停火期升级了这些机制，并开发了使用雷达枪和微波接收器来对抗英国军队“干扰”无线电信号的技术。

> Once the intelligence and UXO people caught up with flash gun techniques, the IRA introduced a method that utilised infra-red sensors of the type used for the remote opening and closing of garage doors. This had the advantage of leaving no chemical forensic evidence behind. Infra-red devices allowed IRA teams to refine the flash technique and detonate explosives from up to a mile away.” It is believed that the IRA used the period of the ceasefire in the 1990s to upgrade such mechanisms and to develop techniques to combat British army ‘disruptive’ radio signals by using radar guns and microwave receivers.


光作为引爆器的其他用途真是巧妙而恶魔。炸弹会被放在汽车里，并连接到一个窗户税票上，这个税票被制成对光敏感。附近的街灯会被临时工作人员破坏。巡逻的警察在夜间检查税票时必须打开手电筒才能看到它：当他把手电筒照在税票上时——砰。其他装置可以通过手套箱灯来触发, 通过改装电子设备并将其连接到炸弹上。据信，这种装置在1981年5月杀死了一名调查纽里一辆废弃汽车的弹药技术官员。

> Other uses of light as a trigger for detonation were truly ingenious and devilish. A bomb would be placed in a car and attached to a window tax disc that was made to be light-sensitive. The nearby street lights would have been knocked out by a Provisional operative. A policeman on patrol checking the tax disc at night would have to turn on his torch to see it: when he shone the torch at the disc — bang.% Other devices could be triggered by the glove compartment light by adapting the electronics and wiring it to the bomb. Such a device was believed to have killed an ATO (ammunition technical officer) investigating an abandoned car in Newry in May 1981.

### ANTI-HANDLING DEVICES: ‘BOOBY TRAPS’

20世纪70年代北爱尔兰麻烦时期早期的一个陷阱和定时装置的例子由乔治·斯泰尔斯描述为一组围绕水泥厂的圆柱形钢容器，每个容器都装有 Quarrex 炸药，通过导火索连接并与中央定时和引爆装置相连。如果中央装置爆炸，它将通过连接的导火索产生能量波并引爆所有容器。结果发现炸弹电池被陷阱设置，必须在使中央引爆装置无害化前先隔离。看来陷阱是在一本美国进口的手册的帮助下制造的。

1971年晚些时候，一个EOD小组不得不处理四个被设置为诡雷的装置，它们都在硬纸鞋盒上方有一个燃尽的安全引线，暗示炸弹引爆失败。每个装置都有防处理开关，如果移动就会爆炸。其中一个装置是一个装满糖和除草剂的盐盒，在底部有一个开关，如果盒子被拿起来就会引爆炸弹。雨水使炸弹失效，从而防止任何试图抬起它的人受伤，但第四个装置实际上夺去了它的放置者的一只胳膊——他犯了一个致命的错误，把炸弹放得太快了。

上世纪70年代 Shane O’Doherty 制造并邮寄的信件炸弹, EOD 操作员 Peter Gurney 将其描述为本质上是防处理装置，所有设计都是在打开时爆炸。书籍炸弹是一种特别巧妙的伪装手段。这些设备将被包裹在纸张中并作为包裹邮寄。解开包裹后，可以看到设备已经被挖空，在里面是一两克 Semtex 和一个陷阱开关机构，实际上包含了一个安全装置，以保护恐怖分子在制造炸弹时不被炸死。

> An example of an early booby trap and timing device in the 1970s Troubles was described by George Styles as a set of cylindrical steel containers surrounding a cement factory, each containing Quarrex explosive connected by detonating cord and to a central timing and detonating device. The central device, if exploded, would create an energy wave through the connecting detonating cord and set off all the containers. It turned out that the bombs battery was booby trapped and had to be isolated before making the central detonating device harmless. It appeared that booby traps were being built with the help of a US -imported manual.”
>
> Later in 1971 an EOD team had to deal with four devices that were booby trapped by having a burnt-out safety fuse on top of cardboardshoe boxes, implying that the bomb had failed to go off. Each device had anti-handling switches which would explode if moved. One device was a salt box packed with sugar and weedkiller with a switch on its base that would set the bomb off if the box were picked up. Rain had rendered the bomb inoperable, thereby preventing injury to anyone trying to lift it, but the fourth device actually claimed one of the arms of its planter — who made the fatal mistake of putting the bomb down too quickly.”
>
> The letter bombs that were built and mailed by Shane O’Doherty during the 1970s are described by EOD operative Peter Gurney as being essentially anti-handling devices, all designed to go off when opened. Book bombs were a particularly cunning means of disguise. These devices would be wrapped into paper and mailed as a parcel. On unwrapping the device, it would be seen to have been hollowed out, and inside it was a gram or two of Semtex and a booby trap switching mechanism, actually containing a safety device for the terrorist to protect him from being blown up while constructing the bomb.”

到1986年，IRA 已经完善了高度复杂的电磁陷阱，通过指挥线引爆。一份情报报告提到，一堵石墙吸引了一只嗅探炸弹的狗的注意，结果发现这堵墙已经用新石头重建，部分引爆后发现墙内隐藏着一个陷阱装置。"" 一种带有线圈的装置被挖入墙底的地面，当使用足够强的电磁场拦截线圈时，炸弹就会被激活。类似的电路被用来防止用反金属探测器 (AMD) 设备检测到，一组组件被接入电路，然后与线圈配合使用，以在军队进行寻找金属的扫描操作时触发炸弹上的开关。

陷阱炸弹是 IRA 的 IEDs 魔鬼般适应能力的顶峰。正如 Nova 电视纪录片《拆弹小组》中一名 EOD 成员所描述的那样，陷阱装置被建造在啤酒桶内，它们被用作主荷载或主爆炸荷载的容器。它们包含大约 45 千克的炸药，并且内部隐藏着一个陷阱开关。助爆剂袋在顶部，提供了初始动力使炸药起作用，并连接到这个隐藏的爆炸装置。如果操作者把手伸进去并拔出助爆剂袋，它就会引爆这个装置，触发所有爆炸荷载，并且被杀死。

整个种植炸弹的地点都可能被设置陷阱。房屋会用绊线和压力垫设置陷阱。如果你站在垫子上，它会完成一个电路，触发一个炸弹。绊线是由细渔线制成的，非常难看到，但一旦在光线闪烁中检测到，就会引导 EOD 成员找到一个自制炸弹。

> By 1986 the IRA had perfected the highly sophisticated electromagnetic booby trap detonated by command wire. An intelligence report told of how a stone wall attracted the attention of a bomb sniffer dog and turned out to have been rebuilt with fresh stones, partial detonation of which revealed a booby trap device concealed within the wall."" A device with a coil of wire had been dug into the ground at the wall base, and the bomb would have been activated when an electromagnetic field of sufficient force was used to intercept the coil. A similar kind of circuit was used to prevent detection with anti-metal detector (AMD) equipment, a set of components that were wired into a circuit and then used in conjunction with a coil to trigger a switch on the bomb whenever an army sweep operation to find metal was carried out.
>
> The booby trap bomb was at the zenith of devilish adaptation of the IRA’s IEDs. As one of the EOD men has described in the Nova television documentary, ‘Bomb Squad’, booby trap devices were built into beer kegs, which were used as the container for the main charge, or main explosive charge. They contained about 45 kg of explosives, and hidden inside was a booby trap switch. The booster bag was on top, which provided the initial kick to get the explosives to function, and was connected to this hidden explosive device. If the operator stuck his hand in and pulled out the booster bag, he would set this device off, triggering all the explosive charge, and be killed.”
>
> Entire locations where bombs were planted could be booby trapped. A house would be booby trapped with trip wires and pressure mats. If you stood on the mat, it would complete an electric circuit, triggering a bomb. The tripwires were made out of thin fishing lines, which are very hard to see, but once detected in a glint of light, would lead the EOD member to a homemade bomb.

### HIGH-TECH ADVANCEMENT: RADAR DETECTORS

In the late 1980s the security forces discovered that the IRA was using radar detectors to detonate car-borne IEDs. The radar detectors — ‘fuzz-busters’ — were first deployed to combat army jamming countermeasures using radar to sweep for devices. Fuzzbusters were originally devised as an electronic device for motorists to determine if their speed was being monitored by traffic police (who would bounce a radio wave off a moving vehicle with a radar gun that determined the vehicle’s speed by the Doppler-effect-moderated change in the wave’s frequency). As described on the internet, the detectors are marketed as simple — ‘Nothing fancy here, it just goes off when it sees radar and that’s it’ — but the IRA used both X and K bands and fitted a decoder, enabling them to detect radar at very large ranges — up to five miles (8 km).
